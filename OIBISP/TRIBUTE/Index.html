            <h2>Tribute to a Great Soul</h2>
            <h3>In 1 April 1889 : </h3>
            <p>
                Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, also known by his moniker Doctorji, was an Indian physician and the founder of
                the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Hedgewar founded the RSS in Nagpur in 1925, based on the ideology
                of Hindutva with the intention of creating a Hindu Rashtra.
            </p>
            <h3>Early Life : </h3>
            <p>
                Hedgewar was born on 1 April 1889 in a Telugu Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmin (DRB) family in Nagpur. His
                parents were Baliram Pant Hedgewar and Revatibai, a couple of modest means. When Hedgewar was thirteen
                both of his parents died in the epidemic of plague of 1902. Hedgewar's uncle ensured that he continued
                to receive a good education, and B. S. Moonje became a patron and a father-figure for the young
                Hedgewar.

                He studied at Neel City High School in Nagpur, from where he was expelled singing "Vande Mataram" in
                violation of the circular issued by the then British colonial government. As a result, he had to pursue
                his high school studies at the Rashtriya Vidyalaya in Yavatmal and later in Pune. After matriculating,
                he was sent to Kolkata by B. S. Moonje (a member of the Indian National Congress, who later became the
                President of the Hindu Mahasabha) in 1910 to pursue his medical studies.[16] After passing the L.M.S.
                Examination from the Calcutta Medical College in June 1916, he completed a yearlong apprenticeship and
                returned to Nagpur in 1917 as a physician.
            </p>
            <h3>Political activities post formation of RSS: </h3>
            <p>
                After founding the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in 1925, Hedgewar maintained a healthy distance from
                Indian Independence movement as led by Gandhi. Instead he encouraged local Swayamsevaks to participate
                on their own accord with the struggle. This lack of enthusiasm in the Independence Movement is heavily
                criticised. Hedgewar was actively discouraging RSS cadres to not join the movement which was led by
                Gandhi.[28] The RSS biographer C. P. Bhishikar states, "after establishing Sangh, Doctor Saheb in his
                speeches used to talk only of Hindu organization. Direct comment on (British) Government used to be
                almost nil."

            </p>
            <h3>Establishment of Rashtra Sevika Samiti : </h3>
            <p>
                Laxmibai Kelkar was the founder of the Rashtra Sevika Samiti. Before establishing the organization,
                Kelkar visited Dr. K.B. Hedgewar, the founder of the RSS, in 1936 and had a long discussion to persuade
                him regarding the need for starting a women's wing in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh itself. Hedgewar,
                though, continued to restrict membership of the RSS to men. However, Hedgewar advised Laxmibai Kelkar to
                establish an entirely separate organization that would be autonomous and independent of the RSS, as both
                groups were ideologically identical. Hedgewar promised Kelkar unconditional solidarity, support and
                guidance for the Samithi. Following this, Kelkar established the Rashtra Sevika Samiti at Wardha on 25
                October 1936.
            </p>
            <h3>Death and legacy : </h3>
            <p>
                His health deteriorated in later years of his life. Often he suffered from chronic back pain. He started
                delegating his responsibilities to M. S. Golwalkar, who later succeeded him as Sarsanghachalak of
                RSS. In January 1940, he was taken to Rajgir in Bihar for the hot-spring treatment.

            </p>

            <p> He attended the annual Sangh Shiksha Varg (officer training camp) in 1940, where he gave his last
                message to Swayamsevaks, saying: 'I see before my eyes today a miniature Hindu Rashtra." He died
                on the morning of 21 June 1940 in Nagpur. His last rites were performed in the locality of Resham Bagh
                in Nagpur, which was later developed as Hedgewar Smruti Mandir.</p>

            <p> Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee described Hegdewar as a great patriot, freedom fighter and nationalist
                during his commemoration on a postal stamp in 1999. Hedgewar was described as "a great son of Mother
                India" by former President of India Pranab Mukherjee during his visit to Hedgewar's birthplace in
                Nagpur.
